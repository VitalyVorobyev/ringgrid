# Backlog

## Status Values
- `todo` — not started
- `in-progress` — actively being worked
- `blocked` — waiting on something
- `done` — completed

## Priority Values
- `P0` — blocking release or correctness
- `P1` — next up
- `P2` — planned
- `P3` — someday

## ID Model
- Backlog ids (`INFRA-011`, `ALGO-014`, `DOCS-003`) are the stable planning ids used in this file.

## API / Interface Tracking

- Rust API backlog direction: add file-oriented JSON/SVG/PNG target-generation API in `ringgrid` crate using direct board geometry args.
- Python API backlog direction: expose the same target-generation capability in `ringgrid-py` package surface (installed-package usable).
- `DetectConfig` backlog direction: internal Python caching/refactor only; no intentional public behavior changes.
- Codebook backlog direction: default profile unchanged; optional extension profile additive and opt-in.
- Proposal module direction: standalone `proposal/` module with no ringgrid-type dependencies in core API; `ProposalConfig` with unified `min_distance`; `find_ellipse_centers()` entry points; `ProposalResult` with `heatmap` field.

## Acceptance Scenarios (Attached to Tasks)

## Locked Defaults

- ID convention: keep existing `ALGO`/`INFRA` streams and add `DOCS-*` for docs-focused backlog work.
- Target-generation outputs in first milestone: JSON + SVG + PNG.
- API style for target generation: file-oriented for both Rust and Python.
- Codebook extension policy: stable base + optional extension, 16-bit only, target extension size = max feasible.
- Root README policy: user-quickstart-first with links to separate developer/performance docs.
